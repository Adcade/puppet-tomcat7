This manifest is based on a sample demo first presented at TomcatExpert:
http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2010/04/29/deploying-tomcat-applications-puppet

As an exercise it was adapted to work with the tomcat7 package from Ubuntu
12.04.  This is still work in progress.

There is a script in the root directory which can be run to try this out:
sudo ./test.sh --noop

The WAR file we are using is from http://simple.souther.us/.
